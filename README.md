# Indigo

Indigo is an engine for conversational machine learning, and is currently in its
early stages, don't expect mind-blowing artificial intelligence or beautiful APIs
just yet.

## Roadmap / Planned Features

* Priority: Give some matches a higher priority
* Context: Let indigo match data with the help of the conversation's context
* REST API: So we can make language independent trainers or bots,
you only need some http (and coffee, probably.)
* Synonym matching: Recognize synonyms when matching.
